# DEPENDENCIES

This React project is dependant on the newest ReactJS version, react-bootstrap and axios.

# RUN DEV VERSION

The built version of the application should run on the dedicated ubuntu server on the university, however the dev build can also be run using npm start in the frontend directory. Changes to the source code can be made on the fly to verify functionality of for instance the error handling. More about running the React app can be found in the README provided by the library authors themselves, in the frontend directory.
